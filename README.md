## The Problem

**Government websites are a mess.**

- Agendas change without warning
- 13 different websites to check
- No notification system
- Critical meetings missed

**You waste 5-10 hours/month** manually checking LA City Council, County Board, Planning Commission, Housing Authority, and 8 other agencies.

## The Solution

**LA Agenda Alerts monitors everything for you.**

Our system checks 13 government sources 3 times daily and sends instant email/SMS alerts when agendas change. No more missed meetings. No more manual checking.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

LA Agenda Alerts is a monitoring and notification service. It does not replace official notices, filings, or legal requirements. Users should always verify critical information with the originating agency.

While we strive for 100% reliability, this is a best-effort service. Free tier users should not rely solely on our alerts for time-sensitive matters. Pro and Org tiers include additional retry logic for higher reliability.

---

| Website not loading | Wait 5 min after GitHub Pages enable, clear cache |
| Dashboard down | Check: python3 v2/dashboard.py |
| No alerts | Check logs: tail -f logs/v2_pipeline.log |
| Payment not working | Use manual: Venmo/PayPal/Zelle |
